```

_You can get your project-id [here](https://app.descope.com/settings/project)_.
_You can get this flow-id from the Flows page [here](https://app.descope.com/flows)_.

2. Open the Cypress App
   Make sure you have the application running at `https://localhost:3000`. Then, in the root directory of the descope-explorer project, run the following to open the Cypress app:

```
npx cypress open
