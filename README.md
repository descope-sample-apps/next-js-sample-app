# Next Descope Example

## Getting Started

1. Create `.env.local` with the following variables:
```env
// .env.local
# Your project id
NEXT_PUBLIC_DESCOPE_PROJECT_ID=<project-id>
# Flow id to run, e.g. sign-up-or-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_DESCOPE_FLOW_ID=<flow-id>
# Optional - Descope base url, either https://api.descope.com, https://api.sandbox.descope.com or http://localhost:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_DESCOPE_BASE_URL=<base-url>
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## App Content
 This app contains 2 components:

### Home Page
a. When user is not logged-in:
 - "Login" button (navigate to "Login page")
 - "Not Validated" user data that returned from server side props (see more details below)

b. When user is logged-in

## What Does Descope Example Shows?
#### Caveat
This is an early stage example. This example may change in the near future. We will appreciate any feedback!

 - `AuthProvider` usage
 The `App` component (`pages/_app.tsx`) is wrapped with `<AuthProvider ... > ... </AuthProvider>` component.

 - `useAuth` usage
The `Home` component (`pages/index.tsx`) uses multiple functions/constants return from this hook, such as `authenticated`, `user`, `logout` and more.

- `Descope` usage
The `Home` component (`pages/index.tsx`) loads Descope in a dynamic manner (CSR only), and renders it.

- Validating session
Validating session (`utils/auth.ts`) uses Descope `NodeJS` sdk instance's `validateSession` method.
This is used in
 - `getServerSideProps` (`pages/index.tsx`), to pass different data fetching.
 - API handler (`pages/api/form.ts`), to validate form request that is called from the `Home` page

 NOTE: For a case that the Descope project manages token response on BODY (in contrast to manage on COOKIES), the Login component set the refresh token on the `DSR` cookie (see `getRefreshToken()` usage).
 This is done in order to be able to use it on `getServerSideProps` data fetching.
Prefer using this function only for testing, and to manage token response in COOKIES. When Descope project manages token response on cookies, Descope set the refresh token, and `getRefreshToken` is not needed
